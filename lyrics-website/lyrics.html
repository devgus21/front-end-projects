        A song to play when I'm lonely
        Win and never play a game again
        No one to face when I'm falling
        Holding tight to dreams that never end

        I'll be you
        I do
        I'll be you
        No one's afraid to be called by another name
        No one dares to be put down where they don't belong
        Nowhere's anyone reason
        Everything dying and leaving
        Out with these faults and you make me baby
        Faking a movement but no one's seeing it
        No one always finds peace flung

        No one chooses to beat my pride down

        Symbols pierce right through me
        People fail to be drawn up

        Sunlight to fate accumalates
        Loving pain to be clung to

        Luminous bodies
        Only waiting for long signs to be wrong
        And true to us
        Out of place in my own time
        Drowning thinking that I'm dry
        Holding onto facts that'll never be proven
        Faking an action cuz no one's looking
        Hello when I'm crashing
        Feel nothing when my life's flashing before my eyes
        You should've threw me down
        Is the content so much

        You should've threw me down
        Is the content so much
        You should've threw me down
        Is the content so much
        You should've threw me down
        Is the content so much
